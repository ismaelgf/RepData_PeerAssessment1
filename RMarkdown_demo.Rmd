# My first R Markdown file
==========================

This is my first R Mrakdown file

```{r}
library(datasets)
data(airquality)
summary(airquality)
```

Lets make a pairs plot of the data

```{r}
pairs(airquality)
```

Here is a regression model of Ozone on Wind, Solar Radiation and Temperature.

```{r}
fit<- lm(Ozone~Wind+Solar.R+Temp, data=airquality)

```
